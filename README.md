# historic-sites

This is a Capstone about historic sites being worked on by Cole, Jeffrey, Keith, Ricardo. 
The purpose of this website is to have a collection of historic locations in and around Albuquerque
that people can visit as well as having a travel list which registered user can use to save locations
they would like to visit. The site will also have what amenities each location will have and if the 
location is free or paid entrance.
